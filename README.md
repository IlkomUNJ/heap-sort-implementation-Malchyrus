How to compile and run :

i use c++ to code so to compile use "g++ main.cpp"

by default it will compile .exe file with the name of "a.exe" (add "-o [filename]" after "g++ main.cpp" to change the compiled file name)

to run use "./(filename)"

Note : if you want to print the maxheap instead of sorted heap, change heapSort to maxHeap in file main.cpp
